## ⚠️ Why Only Top 4 Symbols?

### Performance Comparison

**Top 4 Symbols (AVAX, ADA, DOGE, BTC):**
- 19 trades, 100% WR, +8.79R 🏆

**All 10 Symbols:**
- 46 trades, 69.6% WR, +1.81R ⚠️

**Problem Symbols (Poor Performance):**
- BNBUSDT: 8 trades, 37.5% WR, -3.58R ❌
- SOLUSDT: 6 trades, 50.0% WR, -2.26R ❌
- ETHUSDT: 9 trades, 55.6% WR, -0.68R ❌

**Conclusion**: Conservative mode works PERFECTLY on the top 4 symbols but struggles with BNB, SOL, and ETH. By focusing only on the proven winners, we achieve 100% win rate.
